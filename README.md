d3-vadir
========

This is a very rough prototype of some graphs/data visualizations that may be appropriate for the VADIR dataset explored
during the last Hacks/HackersROC meetup.

Each .html example pulls data from 'data.csv'

I've included a number of iterations of the VADIR data narrowed down and sampled for demonstration purposes.

The very powerful d3.js library and examples can be found here:

Shout out to Mike Bostock for providing such an awesome set of data visualization tools.
